fix: resolve Cloudinary 401 and ensure universal file support

- Switched ProjectFile model to FileField combined with RawMediaCloudinaryStorage.
- Configured Cloudinary to force secure HTTPS URLs (SECURE: True).
- Enabled RawMediaCloudinaryStorage as default to properly handle "raw" assets (non-images).
- Verified fix with a successful test script generating correct 'raw/upload' HTTPS URLs.
- Applied migrations for the model field update.
