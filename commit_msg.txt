feat: implement 'Gatekeeper' logic to enforce subscription limits

- Added helper methods to Organization model (can_add_user, can_create_project, has_feature) for centralized limit checking.
- Updated invite_member view to prevent exceeding the plan's user cap.
- Updated shared_project_create view to enforce the maximum project limit.
- Restricted access to project_analytics based on the 'has_analytics' feature toggle.
- Implemented user-friendly error messages when plan limits are encountered.
