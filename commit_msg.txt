feat: implement granular module permission toggles for internal staff

- Added module_permissions JSONField to the User model.
- Created UI in Platform Admin to toggle access to specific modules (Chat, Projects, Analytics, etc.).
- Implemented has_module_access template filter for conditional navigation rendering.
- Updated base.html (desktop and mobile) to respect individual user permissions.
- Ensured SUPER_ADMINs retain global access regardless of toggles.
