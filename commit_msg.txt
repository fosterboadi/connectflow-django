feat: architectural scaling for subscription enforcement (DRF integration)

- Integrated subscription limit validation into SharedProjectSerializer for API consistency.
- Implemented custom DRF permission class 'HasSubscriptionFeature' for reusable premium feature locking.
- Added premium 'analytics' action to SharedProjectViewSet protected by subscription checks.
- Ensured that both Web and API layers now share the same 'Gatekeeper' logic.
- Optimized app structure for future mobile and third-party integrations.
